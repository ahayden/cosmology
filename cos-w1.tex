\begin{enumerate}
    \item 
      Where the number density $n$ in the star cluster declines as 
      $1/r$, the the total number of objects with a measurable flux 
      $f$ within a radius $r$ to an observer at the center of the cluster 
      is given, with the differential in $r$, by: 

      \begin{equation}
        N = \frac{4}{3} \pi r^3 \left( \frac{n}{r} \right) \implies 
        \dv{N}{r} = \frac{8}{3} \pi r n
      \end{equation}

      The cluster is populated by stars assumed to have uniform luminosity, 
      so the flux $f$ from each source and differential along the radius is:

      \begin{equation}
        f = \frac{L}{4 \pi r^2} \implies \dv{f}{r} = -\frac{L}{2 \pi r^3}
      \end{equation}

      Dividing $(1)$ by $(2)$ yields:
      \[ \dv{N}{f} = -\frac{16 \pi^2 r^4 n }{3 L} \propto r^4 \]

      Because of $(2)$, $r^2 \propto f^{-1}$, which can be substituted into 
      the proportionality to remove dependence on $r$ and to fix $\alpha$:
      \[  \dv{N}{f} \propto f^{-2} = f^{\alpha} \implies \alpha = -2 \]

      Counts are analyzed in logarithmic bins of flux, so it is necessary to
      substitute $\frac{1}{f}\dd{f} = \dd{(\ln{f})}$ into the expression 
      relating count and flux:
      \[ f \dv{N}{f} = \dv{N}{\ln{f}}
      = \mathcal{C} f^{\alpha + 1} = \mathcal{C} f^{-1} \]

      Taking the log of both sides and substitute $\alpha$,
      \[ \log{\left(\dv{N}{\ln{f}}\right)} = (\alpha + 1)\log{f} + \mathcal{C}
      = -\log{f} + \mathcal{C} \]

      In this model, the log binning of the number count of stars in the
      cluster is linearly proportional to the log bin of flux measured by
      the observer. This relationship is due to the $1/r$ decline in number
      density $n$ around the observer, and if they were to determine this
      relationship through measurements, they would be able to discern the
      inhomogeneity of their surroundings. The distribution of stars in the
      cluster is nonhomogeneous, would be isotropic from the perspective of 
      the observer, but not isotropic generally.

        The NRAO VLA Sky Survey (NVSS) measured, over four years, the 1.4 
        GHz flux from field ``snapshot'' views of the sky north of -40, 
        stitched together to make 4°×4° patches with polarization data along 
        the third dimension. A catalog of 2e6 discrete source features with 
        flux density $S$ greater than 2.5 mJy were extracted from the cubes. 
        Measurement error in the position in the sky of point sources varies 
        with the measured irradiance, from 7" uncertainty at the lower limit 
        to less than 1" in the bin of highest $S$. The catalog derived from
        this data set includes ``radio galaxies and quasars\ldots ultraluminous 
        starburst galaxies even at cosmological distances, plus statistically 
        useful numbers of nearby ``normal'' galaxies, low-luminosity 
        active galactic nuclei (AGNs), Galactic planetary nebulae, pulsars, 
        and stars.''\cite{Condon_1998}

      \item
        The Two Micron All Sky Survey (2MASS) recorded data in three 
        near-infrared bandpasses in the J, H, and Ks bands, simultaneously. 
        The survey covered nearly the entire sky from two ground-based 1.3m 
        diameter telescopes over four years. Integrating the flux from each 
        point over 7.8s allowed for detecting sources of minimum magnitude 
        15.8, 15.1, and 14.3 in each of band respectively.\cite{Skrutskie_2006}

      \item
        Using the 2MASS data as input to select targets in the Ks band, the
        2MASS Redshift Survey (2MRS) mapped the distributions of nearby
        galaxies in 3D space using spectroscopy to determine the redshift, 
        and redshift as a proxy for distance. This survey started with a 
        sample of 44,599 2MASS galaxies with magnitude in the Ks band  
        brighter than 11.75 outside of the galactic plane by 5° (and by 8°
        near the center). The research team measured spectroscopy for 11,000
        samples to complete 97.6\% of the samples in the original data set at 
        the point of relase, covering 91\% of the sky.\cite{Huchra_2012}
