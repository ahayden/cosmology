    sky. Bright source extractions have 1 σ photometric uncertainty of 
    \<0.03 mag and astrometric accuracy of order 100 mas. Calibration offsets 
    between any two points in the sky are \<0.02 mag. The 2MASS All-Sky Data

	abstract = {We present the results of the 2MASS Redshift Survey (2MRS), 
    a ten-year project to map the full three-dimensional distribution of 
    galaxies in the nearby universe. The Two Micron All Sky Survey (2MASS) 
    was completed in 2003 and its final data products, including an extended 
    source catalog (XSC), are available online. The 2MASS XSC contains nearly 
    a million galaxies with Ks ⩽ 13.5 mag and is essentially complete and 
    mostly unaffected by interstellar extinction and stellar confusion down 
    to a galactic latitude of |b| = 5° for bright galaxies. Near-infrared 
    wavelengths are sensitive to the old stellar populations that dominate 
    galaxy masses, making 2MASS an excellent starting point to study the 
    distribution of matter in the nearby universe. We selected a sample of 
    44,599 2MASS galaxies with Ks ⩽ 11.75 mag and |b| ⩾ 5° (⩾8° toward the 
    Galactic bulge) as the input catalog for our survey. We obtained 
    spectroscopic observations for 11,000 galaxies and used previously 
    obtained velocities for the remainder of the sample to generate a 
    redshift catalog that is 97.6\% complete to well-defined limits and 
    covers 91\% of the sky. This provides an unprecedented census of galaxy 
    (baryonic mass) concentrations within 300 Mpc. Earlier versions of our 
    survey have been used in a number of publications that have studied the 
    bulk motion of the Local Group, mapped the density and peculiar velocity 
    fields out to 50 h−1 Mpc, detected galaxy groups, and estimated the 
    values of several cosmological parameters. Additionally, we present 
    morphological types for a nearly complete sub-sample of 20,860 galaxies 
    with Ks ⩽ 11.25 mag and |b| ⩾ 10°.}

Due to the collision of two clusters, the dissipationless stellar component and the fluid-like X-ray-emitting plasma are spatially segregated. By using both wide-field ground-based images and HST/ACS images of the cluster cores, we create gravitational lensing maps showing that the gravitational potential does not trace the plasma distribution, the dominant baryonic mass component, but rather approximately traces the distribution of galaxies. An 8 σ significance spatial offset of the center of the total mass from the center of the baryonic mass peaks cannot be explained with an alteration of the gravitational force law and thus proves that the majority of the matter in the system is unseen.}

    abstract = "{A comparison between published field galaxy stellar mass functions (GSMFs) shows that the cosmic stellar mass density is in the range 4–8 per cent of the baryon density (assuming Ωb= 0.045). There remain significant sources of uncertainty for the dust correction and underlying stellar mass-to-light ratio even assuming a reasonable universal stellar initial mass function. We determine the z \\&lt; 0.05 GSMF using the New York University Value-Added Galaxy Catalog sample of 49 968 galaxies derived from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey and various estimates of stellar mass. The GSMF shows clear evidence for a low-mass upturn and is fitted with a double Schechter function that has α2≃−1.6. At masses below ∼108.5M⊙, the GSMF may be significantly incomplete because of missing low-surface-brightness galaxies. One interpretation of the stellar mass–metallicity relation is that it is primarily caused by a lower fraction of available baryons converted to stars in low-mass galaxies. Using this principle, we determine a simple relationship between baryonic mass and stellar mass and present an ‘implied baryonic mass function’. This function has a faint-end slope, α2≃−1.9. Thus, we find evidence that the slope of the low-mass end of the galaxy mass function could plausibly be as steep as the halo mass function. We illustrate the relationship between halo baryonic mass function → galaxy baryonic mass function → GSMF. This demonstrates the requirement for peak galaxy formation efficiency at baryonic masses ∼1011M⊙ corresponding to a minimum in feedback effects. The baryonic-infall efficiency may have levelled off at lower masses.}",

    abstract = { The gas surrounding galaxies outside their disks or interstellar medium and inside their virial radii is known as the circumgalactic medium (CGM). In recent years this component of galaxies has assumed an important role in our understanding of galaxy evolution owing to rapid advances in observational access to this diffuse, nearly invisible material. Observations and simulations of this component of galaxies suggest that it is a multiphase medium characterized by rich dynamics and complex ionization states. The CGM is a source for a galaxy's star-forming fuel, the venue for galactic feedback and recycling, and perhaps the key regulator of the galactic gas supply. We review our evolving knowledge of the CGM with emphasis on its mass, dynamical state, and coevolution with galaxies. Observations from all redshifts and from across the electromagnetic spectrum indicate that CGM gas has a key role in galaxy evolution. We summarize the state of this field and pose unanswered questions for future research. }
