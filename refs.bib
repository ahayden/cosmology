	abstract = {We present the results of the 2MASS Redshift Survey (2MRS), 
    a ten-year project to map the full three-dimensional distribution of 
    galaxies in the nearby universe. The Two Micron All Sky Survey (2MASS) 
    was completed in 2003 and its final data products, including an extended 
    source catalog (XSC), are available online. The 2MASS XSC contains nearly 
    a million galaxies with Ks ⩽ 13.5 mag and is essentially complete and 
    mostly unaffected by interstellar extinction and stellar confusion down 
    to a galactic latitude of |b| = 5° for bright galaxies. Near-infrared 
    wavelengths are sensitive to the old stellar populations that dominate 
    galaxy masses, making 2MASS an excellent starting point to study the 
    distribution of matter in the nearby universe. We selected a sample of 
    44,599 2MASS galaxies with Ks ⩽ 11.75 mag and |b| ⩾ 5° (⩾8° toward the 
    Galactic bulge) as the input catalog for our survey. We obtained 
    spectroscopic observations for 11,000 galaxies and used previously 
    obtained velocities for the remainder of the sample to generate a 
    redshift catalog that is 97.6\% complete to well-defined limits and 
    covers 91\% of the sky. This provides an unprecedented census of galaxy 
    (baryonic mass) concentrations within 300 Mpc. Earlier versions of our 
    survey have been used in a number of publications that have studied the 
    bulk motion of the Local Group, mapped the density and peculiar velocity 
    fields out to 50 h−1 Mpc, detected galaxy groups, and estimated the 
    values of several cosmological parameters. Additionally, we present 
    morphological types for a nearly complete sub-sample of 20,860 galaxies 
    with Ks ⩽ 11.25 mag and |b| ⩾ 10°.}

Due to the collision of two clusters, the dissipationless stellar component and the fluid-like X-ray-emitting plasma are spatially segregated. By using both wide-field ground-based images and HST/ACS images of the cluster cores, we create gravitational lensing maps showing that the gravitational potential does not trace the plasma distribution, the dominant baryonic mass component, but rather approximately traces the distribution of galaxies. An 8 σ significance spatial offset of the center of the total mass from the center of the baryonic mass peaks cannot be explained with an alteration of the gravitational force law and thus proves that the majority of the matter in the system is unseen.}

    abstract = "{A comparison between published field galaxy stellar mass functions (GSMFs) shows that the cosmic stellar mass density is in the range 4–8 per cent of the baryon density (assuming Ωb= 0.045). There remain significant sources of uncertainty for the dust correction and underlying stellar mass-to-light ratio even assuming a reasonable universal stellar initial mass function. We determine the z \\&lt; 0.05 GSMF using the New York University Value-Added Galaxy Catalog sample of 49 968 galaxies derived from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey and various estimates of stellar mass. The GSMF shows clear evidence for a low-mass upturn and is fitted with a double Schechter function that has α2≃−1.6. At masses below ∼108.5M⊙, the GSMF may be significantly incomplete because of missing low-surface-brightness galaxies. One interpretation of the stellar mass–metallicity relation is that it is primarily caused by a lower fraction of available baryons converted to stars in low-mass galaxies. Using this principle, we determine a simple relationship between baryonic mass and stellar mass and present an ‘implied baryonic mass function’. This function has a faint-end slope, α2≃−1.9. Thus, we find evidence that the slope of the low-mass end of the galaxy mass function could plausibly be as steep as the halo mass function. We illustrate the relationship between halo baryonic mass function → galaxy baryonic mass function → GSMF. This demonstrates the requirement for peak galaxy formation efficiency at baryonic masses ∼1011M⊙ corresponding to a minimum in feedback effects. The baryonic-infall efficiency may have levelled off at lower masses.}",

    abstract = {The gas surrounding galaxies outside their disks or interstellar medium and inside their virial radii is known as the circumgalactic medium (CGM). In recent years this component of galaxies has assumed an important role in our understanding of galaxy evolution owing to rapid advances in observational access to this diffuse, nearly invisible material. Observations and simulations of this component of galaxies suggest that it is a multiphase medium characterized by rich dynamics and complex ionization states. The CGM is a source for a galaxy's star-forming fuel, the venue for galactic feedback and recycling, and perhaps the key regulator of the galactic gas supply. We review our evolving knowledge of the CGM with emphasis on its mass, dynamical state, and coevolution with galaxies. Observations from all redshifts and from across the electromagnetic spectrum indicate that CGM gas has a key role in galaxy evolution. We summarize the state of this field and pose unanswered questions for future research. }

The luminosity distances of these objects are determined by methods that employ relations between SN Ia luminosity and light curve shape. Combined with previous data from our High-z Supernova Search Team and recent results by Riess et al., this expanded set of 16 high-redshift supernovae and a set of 34 nearby supernovae are used to place constraints on the following cosmological parameters: the Hubble constant (H0), the mass density (ΩM), the cosmological constant (i.e., the vacuum energy density, ΩΛ), the deceleration parameter (q0), and the dynamical age of the universe (t0). The distances of the high-redshift SNe Ia are, on average, 10\%–15\% farther than expected in a low mass density (ΩM = 0.2) universe without a cosmological constant. Different light curve fitting methods, SN Ia subsamples, and prior constraints unanimously favor eternally expanding models with positive cosmological constant (i.e., ΩΛ > 0) and a current acceleration of the expansion (i.e., q0 < 0). With no prior constraint on mass density other than ΩM ≥ 0, the spectroscopically confirmed SNe Ia are statistically consistent with q0 < 0 at the 2.8 σ and 3.9 σ confidence levels, and with ΩΛ > 0 at the 3.0 σ and 4.0 σ confidence levels, for two different fitting methods, respectively. Fixing a "minimal" mass density, ΩM = 0.2, results in the weakest detection, ΩΛ > 0 at the 3.0 σ confidence level from one of the two methods. For a flat universe prior (ΩM + ΩΛ = 1), the spectroscopically confirmed SNe Ia require ΩΛ > 0 at 7 σ and 9 σ formal statistical significance for the two different fitting methods. A universe closed by ordinary matter (i.e., ΩM = 1) is formally ruled out at the 7 σ to 8 σ confidence level for the two different fitting methods. We estimate the dynamical age of the universe to be 14.2 ± 1.7 Gyr including systematic uncertainties in the current Cepheid distance scale. We estimate the likely effect of several sources of systematic error, including progenitor and metallicity evolution, extinction, sample selection bias, local perturbations in the expansion rate, gravitational lensing, and sample contamination. Presently, none of these effects appear to reconcile the data with ΩΛ = 0 and q0 ≥ 0.}

	title = {Constraining the Cosmic Baryon Distribution with Fast Radio Burst Foreground Mapping},
	journal = {The Astrophysical Journal},
	abstract = {The dispersion measure of fast radio bursts (FRBs) encodes the integrated electron density along the line of sight, which is typically dominated by the intergalactic medium contribution in the case of extragalactic FRBs. In this paper, we show that incorporating wide-field spectroscopic galaxy survey data in the foreground of localized FRBs can significantly improve constraints on the partition of diffuse cosmic baryons. Using mock dispersion measures and realistic light-cone galaxy catalogs derived from the Millennium simulation, we define spectroscopic surveys that can be carried out with 4 and 8 m class wide-field spectroscopic facilities. On these simulated surveys, we carry out Bayesian density reconstructions in order to estimate the foreground matter density field. In comparison with the “true” matter density field, we show that these can help reduce the uncertainties in the foreground structures by ∼2–3× compared to cosmic variance. We calculate the Fisher matrix to forecast that N = 30 (96) localized FRBs should be able to constrain the diffuse cosmic baryon fraction to ∼10\% (∼5\%) and parameters governing the size and baryon fraction of galaxy circumgalactic halos to within ∼20\%–25\% (∼8\%–12\%). From the Fisher analysis, we show that the foreground data increase the sensitivity of localized FRBs toward our parameters of interest by ∼25×. We briefly introduce FLIMFLAM, an ongoing galaxy redshift survey that aims to obtain foreground data on ∼30 localized FRB fields.}

The survey detected the baryon acoustic oscillation signal in the large-scale distribution of galaxies over the redshift range 0.2 \\&lt; z \\&lt; 1.0, confirming the acceleration of the expansion of the Universe and measuring the rate of structure growth within it. Here, we present the final data release of the survey: a catalogue of 225 415 galaxies and individual files of the galaxy spectra. We analyse the emission-line properties of these UV-luminous Lyman-break galaxies by stacking the spectra in bins of luminosity, redshift, and stellar mass. The most luminous (\\$-25 \\rm \\, mag\\&lt;M\_\\{\\rm FUV\\}\\&lt;-22 \\rm \\, mag\\$) galaxies have very broad Hβ emission from active nuclei, as well as a broad second component to the [O iii] (495.9 nm, 500.7 nm) doublet lines that is blueshifted by 100 km s−1 , indicating the presence of gas outflows in these galaxies. The composite spectra allow us to detect and measure the temperature-sensitive [O iii] (436.3 nm) line and obtain metallicities using the direct method. The metallicities of intermediate stellar mass (8.8 \\&lt; log (M*/M⊙) \\&lt; 10) WiggleZ galaxies are consistent with normal emission-line galaxies at the same masses. In contrast, the metallicities of high stellar mass (10 \\&lt; log (M*/M⊙) \\&lt; 12) WiggleZ galaxies are significantly lower than for normal emission-line galaxies at the same masses. This is not an effect of evolution as the metallicities do not vary with redshift; it is most likely a property specific to the extremely UV-luminous WiggleZ galaxies.}",

The new observations, at a spatial resolution ∼2.5 times higher than before, reveal a regular H i disc rotating at about 23 km s−1. Our kinematic parameters, recovered with a robust 3D kinematic modelling fitting technique, show that the flat part of the rotation curve is reached. Intriguingly, the rotation curve can be explained almost entirely by the baryonic mass distribution alone. We show that a standard cold dark matter halo that follows the concentration–halo mass relation fails to reproduce the amplitude of the rotation curve by a large margin. Only a halo with an extremely (and arguably unfeasible) low concentration reaches agreement with the data. We also find that the rotation curve of AGC 114905 deviates strongly from the predictions of modified Newtonian dynamics. The inclination of the galaxy, which is measured independently from our modelling, remains the largest uncertainty in our analysis, but the associated errors are not large enough to reconcile the galaxy with the expectations of cold dark matter or modified Newtonian dynamics.}",

    abstract = "{Unlike other observational signatures in cosmology, the angular-diameter distance dA(z) uniquely reaches a maximum (at zmax) and then shrinks to zero towards the big bang. The location of this turning point depends sensitively on the model, but has been difficult to measure. In this paper, we estimate and use zmax inferred from quasar cores: (1) by employing a sample of 140 objects yielding a much reduced dispersion due to pre-constrained limits on their spectral index and luminosity, (2) by reconstructing dA(z) using Gaussian processes, and (3) comparing the predictions of seven different cosmologies and showing that the measured value of zmax can effectively discriminate between them. We find that zmax = 1.70 ± 0.20 – an important new probe of the Universe’s geometry. The most strongly favoured model is Rh = ct, followed by PlanckΛCDM. Several others, including Milne, Einstein-de Sitter, and Static tired light are strongly rejected. According to these results, the Rh = ct universe, which predicts zmax = 1.718, has a \\$\\{\\sim \\} 92.8\\{\\{\\ \\rm per\\ cent\\}\\}\\$ probability of being the correct cosmology. For consistency, we also carry out model selection based on dA(z) itself. This test confirms that Rh = ct and PlanckΛCDM are among the few models that account for angular-size data better than those that are disfavoured by zmax. The dA(z) comparison, however, is less discerning than that with zmax, due to the additional free parameter, H0. We find that H0 = 63.4 ± 1.2 km s−1 Mpc−1 for Rh = ct, and 69.9 ± 1.5 km s−1 Mpc−1 for ΛCDM. Both are consistent with previously measured values in each model, though they differ from each other by over 4σ. In contrast, model selection based on zmax is independent of H0.}",

Like the ΛCDM, the Rh = ct universe is based on a Friedmann–Robertson–Walker (FRW) cosmology where the total energy density ρ and pressure p of the cosmic fluid contain a dark energy component besides the usual (dark and baryonic) matter and radiation components. However, unlike the ΛCDM this model has the simple equation of state ρ + 3p = 0, i.e. its total active gravitational mass vanishes, which would therefore exclude a cosmological constant as the source of its dark energy component. Faced with this issue, in this paper, we examine various possible sources for the dark energy component of the Rh = ct universe and show that quintessence which has been used in other various dynamical dark energy models could also be a possible source in this case.}",

	journal = {Classical and Quantum Gravity},
	abstract = {The tension between early and late Universe probes of the Hubble constant has motivated various new FLRW cosmologies. Here, we reanalyse the Hubble tension with a recent age of the Universe constraint. This allows us to restrict attention to matter and a dark energy sector that we treat without assuming a specific model. Assuming analyticity of the Hubble parameter H(z), and a generic low redshift modification to flat ΛCDM, we find that low redshift data (z ≲ 2.5) and well-motivated priors only permit a dark energy sector close to the cosmological constant Λ. This restriction rules out late Universe modifications within FLRW. We show that early Universe physics that alters the sound horizon can yield an upper limit of H 0 ∼ 71 ± 1 km s−1 Mpc−1. Since various local determinations may be converging to H 0 ∼ 73 km s−1 Mpc−1, a breakdown of the FLRW framework is a plausible resolution. We outline how future data, in particular strongly lensed quasar data, could also provide further confirmations of such a resolution.}

    abstract = "{The hierarchical growth of mass in the Universe is a pillar of all cold dark matter (CDM) models. In this paper we demonstrate that this principle leads to a robust, falsifiable prediction of the stellar content of groups and clusters, which is testable with current observations and is relatively insensitive to the details of baryonic physics or cosmological parameters. Since it is difficult to preferentially remove stars from dark matter dominated systems, when these systems merge the fraction of total mass in stars can only increase (via star formation) or remain constant, relative to the fraction in the combined systems prior to the merger. Therefore, hierarchical models can put strong constraints on the observed correlation between stellar fraction, f*, and total system mass, M500. In particular, if this relation is fixed and does not evolve with redshift, CDM models predict b= d log f*/d log M500≳−0.3. This constraint can be weakened if the f*–M500 relation evolves strongly, but this implies more stars must be formed in situ in groups at low redshift. Conservatively requiring that at least half the stars in groups were formed by z= 1, the constraint from evolution models is b≳−0.35. Since the most massive clusters (M∼ 1015M⊙) are observed to have f*∼ 0.01, this means that groups with M= 5 × 1013M⊙ must have f*≤ 0.03. Recent observations by Gonzalez, Zaritsky \\&amp; Zabludoff indicate a much steeper relation, with f* \\&gt; 0.04 in groups leading to b≈−0.64. If confirmed, this would rule out hierarchical structure formation models: today's clusters could not have been built from today's groups, or even from the higher redshift progenitors of those groups. We perform a careful analysis of these and other data to identify the most important systematic uncertainties in their measurements. Although correlated uncertainties on stellar and total masses might explain the steep observed relation, the data are only consistent with theory if the observed group masses are systematically underestimated.}",

    abstract = "{In this paper, we analyse in detail the mass-accretion histories and structural properties of dark haloes in high-resolution N-body simulations. We model the density distribution in individual haloes using the Navarro—Frenk—White (NFW) profile. For a given halo, there is a tight correlation between its inner-scale radius rs and the mass within it, Ms, for all its main progenitors. Using this correlation, one can predict quite well the structural properties of a dark halo at any time in its history from its mass-accretion history, implying that the structure properties and the mass-accretion history are closely correlated. The predicted growing rate of concentration c with time tends to increase with decreasing mass-accretion rate. The build-up of dark haloes in cold dark matter (CDM) models generally consists of an early phase of fast accretion (where the halo mass Mh increases with time much faster than the expansion rate of the Universe) and a late phase of slow accretion (where Mh increases with time approximately as the expansion rate). These two phases are separated at a time when c ∼ 4 and the typical binding energy of the halo is approximately equal to that of a singular isothermal sphere with the same circular velocity. Haloes in the two accretion phases show systematically different properties, for example, the circular velocity vh increases rapidly with time in the fast accretion phase but remains almost constant in the slow accretion phase, the inner properties of a halo, such as rs and Ms increase rapidly with time in the fast accretion phase but change only slowly in the slow accretion phase, the inner circular velocity vs is approximately equal to vh in the fast accretion phase but is larger in the slow accretion phase. The potential well associated with a halo is built up mainly in the fast accretion phase, while a large amount of mass can be accreted in the slow accretion phase without changing the potential well significantly. We discuss our results in connection with the formation of dark haloes and galaxies in hierarchical models.}",

We explore the suggestion that the baryon asymmetry might be produced at the transition, if the transitionis first order. We find that the asymmetry is proportional to a CP violating parameter, a large power of the gauge coupling and to factors which depend on the details of the transition. In extensions of the standard model, such as multi-Higgs or supersymmetric models, the result may be consistent with observations.}

In the Standard Model, the complete phase diagram has been reliably determined, and the conclusion is that there is no phase transition at all for the experimentally allowed Higgs masses. In the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (MSSM), in contrast, there can be a strong first order transition allowing for baryogenesis. Finally, we point out possibilities for future simulations, such as the problem of CP-violation at the MSSM electroweak phase boundary.}
