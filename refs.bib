	abstract = {We present the results of the 2MASS Redshift Survey (2MRS), 
    a ten-year project to map the full three-dimensional distribution of 
    galaxies in the nearby universe. The Two Micron All Sky Survey (2MASS) 
    was completed in 2003 and its final data products, including an extended 
    source catalog (XSC), are available online. The 2MASS XSC contains nearly 
    a million galaxies with Ks ⩽ 13.5 mag and is essentially complete and 
    mostly unaffected by interstellar extinction and stellar confusion down 
    to a galactic latitude of |b| = 5° for bright galaxies. Near-infrared 
    wavelengths are sensitive to the old stellar populations that dominate 
    galaxy masses, making 2MASS an excellent starting point to study the 
    distribution of matter in the nearby universe. We selected a sample of 
    44,599 2MASS galaxies with Ks ⩽ 11.75 mag and |b| ⩾ 5° (⩾8° toward the 
    Galactic bulge) as the input catalog for our survey. We obtained 
    spectroscopic observations for 11,000 galaxies and used previously 
    obtained velocities for the remainder of the sample to generate a 
    redshift catalog that is 97.6\% complete to well-defined limits and 
    covers 91\% of the sky. This provides an unprecedented census of galaxy 
    (baryonic mass) concentrations within 300 Mpc. Earlier versions of our 
    survey have been used in a number of publications that have studied the 
    bulk motion of the Local Group, mapped the density and peculiar velocity 
    fields out to 50 h−1 Mpc, detected galaxy groups, and estimated the 
    values of several cosmological parameters. Additionally, we present 
    morphological types for a nearly complete sub-sample of 20,860 galaxies 
    with Ks ⩽ 11.25 mag and |b| ⩾ 10°.}

Due to the collision of two clusters, the dissipationless stellar component and the fluid-like X-ray-emitting plasma are spatially segregated. By using both wide-field ground-based images and HST/ACS images of the cluster cores, we create gravitational lensing maps showing that the gravitational potential does not trace the plasma distribution, the dominant baryonic mass component, but rather approximately traces the distribution of galaxies. An 8 σ significance spatial offset of the center of the total mass from the center of the baryonic mass peaks cannot be explained with an alteration of the gravitational force law and thus proves that the majority of the matter in the system is unseen.}

    abstract = "{A comparison between published field galaxy stellar mass functions (GSMFs) shows that the cosmic stellar mass density is in the range 4–8 per cent of the baryon density (assuming Ωb= 0.045). There remain significant sources of uncertainty for the dust correction and underlying stellar mass-to-light ratio even assuming a reasonable universal stellar initial mass function. We determine the z \\&lt; 0.05 GSMF using the New York University Value-Added Galaxy Catalog sample of 49 968 galaxies derived from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey and various estimates of stellar mass. The GSMF shows clear evidence for a low-mass upturn and is fitted with a double Schechter function that has α2≃−1.6. At masses below ∼108.5M⊙, the GSMF may be significantly incomplete because of missing low-surface-brightness galaxies. One interpretation of the stellar mass–metallicity relation is that it is primarily caused by a lower fraction of available baryons converted to stars in low-mass galaxies. Using this principle, we determine a simple relationship between baryonic mass and stellar mass and present an ‘implied baryonic mass function’. This function has a faint-end slope, α2≃−1.9. Thus, we find evidence that the slope of the low-mass end of the galaxy mass function could plausibly be as steep as the halo mass function. We illustrate the relationship between halo baryonic mass function → galaxy baryonic mass function → GSMF. This demonstrates the requirement for peak galaxy formation efficiency at baryonic masses ∼1011M⊙ corresponding to a minimum in feedback effects. The baryonic-infall efficiency may have levelled off at lower masses.}",

    abstract = {The gas surrounding galaxies outside their disks or interstellar medium and inside their virial radii is known as the circumgalactic medium (CGM). In recent years this component of galaxies has assumed an important role in our understanding of galaxy evolution owing to rapid advances in observational access to this diffuse, nearly invisible material. Observations and simulations of this component of galaxies suggest that it is a multiphase medium characterized by rich dynamics and complex ionization states. The CGM is a source for a galaxy's star-forming fuel, the venue for galactic feedback and recycling, and perhaps the key regulator of the galactic gas supply. We review our evolving knowledge of the CGM with emphasis on its mass, dynamical state, and coevolution with galaxies. Observations from all redshifts and from across the electromagnetic spectrum indicate that CGM gas has a key role in galaxy evolution. We summarize the state of this field and pose unanswered questions for future research. }

The luminosity distances of these objects are determined by methods that employ relations between SN Ia luminosity and light curve shape. Combined with previous data from our High-z Supernova Search Team and recent results by Riess et al., this expanded set of 16 high-redshift supernovae and a set of 34 nearby supernovae are used to place constraints on the following cosmological parameters: the Hubble constant (H0), the mass density (ΩM), the cosmological constant (i.e., the vacuum energy density, ΩΛ), the deceleration parameter (q0), and the dynamical age of the universe (t0). The distances of the high-redshift SNe Ia are, on average, 10\%–15\% farther than expected in a low mass density (ΩM = 0.2) universe without a cosmological constant. Different light curve fitting methods, SN Ia subsamples, and prior constraints unanimously favor eternally expanding models with positive cosmological constant (i.e., ΩΛ > 0) and a current acceleration of the expansion (i.e., q0 < 0). With no prior constraint on mass density other than ΩM ≥ 0, the spectroscopically confirmed SNe Ia are statistically consistent with q0 < 0 at the 2.8 σ and 3.9 σ confidence levels, and with ΩΛ > 0 at the 3.0 σ and 4.0 σ confidence levels, for two different fitting methods, respectively. Fixing a "minimal" mass density, ΩM = 0.2, results in the weakest detection, ΩΛ > 0 at the 3.0 σ confidence level from one of the two methods. For a flat universe prior (ΩM + ΩΛ = 1), the spectroscopically confirmed SNe Ia require ΩΛ > 0 at 7 σ and 9 σ formal statistical significance for the two different fitting methods. A universe closed by ordinary matter (i.e., ΩM = 1) is formally ruled out at the 7 σ to 8 σ confidence level for the two different fitting methods. We estimate the dynamical age of the universe to be 14.2 ± 1.7 Gyr including systematic uncertainties in the current Cepheid distance scale. We estimate the likely effect of several sources of systematic error, including progenitor and metallicity evolution, extinction, sample selection bias, local perturbations in the expansion rate, gravitational lensing, and sample contamination. Presently, none of these effects appear to reconcile the data with ΩΛ = 0 and q0 ≥ 0.}

	title = {Constraining the Cosmic Baryon Distribution with Fast Radio Burst Foreground Mapping},
	journal = {The Astrophysical Journal},
	abstract = {The dispersion measure of fast radio bursts (FRBs) encodes the integrated electron density along the line of sight, which is typically dominated by the intergalactic medium contribution in the case of extragalactic FRBs. In this paper, we show that incorporating wide-field spectroscopic galaxy survey data in the foreground of localized FRBs can significantly improve constraints on the partition of diffuse cosmic baryons. Using mock dispersion measures and realistic light-cone galaxy catalogs derived from the Millennium simulation, we define spectroscopic surveys that can be carried out with 4 and 8 m class wide-field spectroscopic facilities. On these simulated surveys, we carry out Bayesian density reconstructions in order to estimate the foreground matter density field. In comparison with the “true” matter density field, we show that these can help reduce the uncertainties in the foreground structures by ∼2–3× compared to cosmic variance. We calculate the Fisher matrix to forecast that N = 30 (96) localized FRBs should be able to constrain the diffuse cosmic baryon fraction to ∼10\% (∼5\%) and parameters governing the size and baryon fraction of galaxy circumgalactic halos to within ∼20\%–25\% (∼8\%–12\%). From the Fisher analysis, we show that the foreground data increase the sensitivity of localized FRBs toward our parameters of interest by ∼25×. We briefly introduce FLIMFLAM, an ongoing galaxy redshift survey that aims to obtain foreground data on ∼30 localized FRB fields.}

    abstract = "{The WiggleZ Dark Energy Survey measured the redshifts of over 200 000 ultraviolet (UV)-selected (NUV \\&lt; 22.8 mag) galaxies on the Anglo-Australian Telescope. The survey detected the baryon acoustic oscillation signal in the large-scale distribution of galaxies over the redshift range 0.2 \\&lt; z \\&lt; 1.0, confirming the acceleration of the expansion of the Universe and measuring the rate of structure growth within it. Here, we present the final data release of the survey: a catalogue of 225 415 galaxies and individual files of the galaxy spectra. We analyse the emission-line properties of these UV-luminous Lyman-break galaxies by stacking the spectra in bins of luminosity, redshift, and stellar mass. The most luminous (\\$-25 \\rm \\, mag\\&lt;M\_\\{\\rm FUV\\}\\&lt;-22 \\rm \\, mag\\$) galaxies have very broad Hβ emission from active nuclei, as well as a broad second component to the [O iii] (495.9 nm, 500.7 nm) doublet lines that is blueshifted by 100 km s−1 , indicating the presence of gas outflows in these galaxies. The composite spectra allow us to detect and measure the temperature-sensitive [O iii] (436.3 nm) line and obtain metallicities using the direct method. The metallicities of intermediate stellar mass (8.8 \\&lt; log (M*/M⊙) \\&lt; 10) WiggleZ galaxies are consistent with normal emission-line galaxies at the same masses. In contrast, the metallicities of high stellar mass (10 \\&lt; log (M*/M⊙) \\&lt; 12) WiggleZ galaxies are significantly lower than for normal emission-line galaxies at the same masses. This is not an effect of evolution as the metallicities do not vary with redshift; it is most likely a property specific to the extremely UV-luminous WiggleZ galaxies.}",
