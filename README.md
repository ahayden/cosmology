# Cosmology

Compile latex locally using the Makefile to run the docker container defined
in `docker-compose.yaml`, i.e. `make cos-w2.pdf` will compile `cos-w1.tex`
This container is registered in 
[the texbox repo](https://github.com/ahayden/texbox). 

The [Actions workflow](https://github.com/ahayden/cosmology/actions) on this
repository makes PDF artifacts.
